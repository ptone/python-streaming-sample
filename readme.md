# Python Streaming Sample

_Note: readme is AI generated ;-)_

This is a simple Python FastAPI app that demonstrates how to stream data from a generator function.

## Usage

To run the app, clone the repository and run the following command:

    uvicorn main:app

Then, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/`. You should see a message that says "Hello World".

To stream data, go to `http://localhost:8000/experimental/stream`. You should see a stream of data that is generated by the `stream_generator()` function.

## How it works

The `stream_generator()` function is a generator function that yields data one line at a time. The `StreamingResponse` class is used to wrap the generator function and stream the data to the client.

The `stream_response()` function is a FastAPI route that returns the `StreamingResponse` object.

## Next steps

You can use this app as a starting point to build your own streaming applications. For example, you could use it to stream data from a database or from a real-time data source.
